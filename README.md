Timings are measured on my computer in a non-scientific way.
Empty durations indicate a runtime of less than a few milliseconds.

## Requirements

### Python 3.12

Package requirements are specified in the **[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)** file.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should install the pre-commit hooks and its dependencies to format the code before committing.

```sh
pip install pre-commit black isort flake8
pre-commit install
```
